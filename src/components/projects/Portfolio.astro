  <h2 class="text-neutral-800 font-medium">Crafting my portfolio</h2>
  <span class="px-2">
    Here is a short story about building my portfolio. I wanted to build a
    personal portfolio website where I can showcase my notable projects, share
    my thoughts, and connect with the world.
  </span>
  <div class="px-2 flex flex-col">
    <span class="font-medium">Planning and technologies</span>
    <span>
      I wanted to create a simple and minimalistic site. I enjoy working on
      UI/UX, so I wanted the site to look good as well. I had to choose a
      framework. Something that matched my requirements. I knew that Next.js
      comes with too much stuff that I don't need for this kind of project. I
      decided to choose <a
        class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
        href="https://astro.build/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >
        Astro.</a
      >
    </span>
  </div>
  <span class="px-2">
    In terms of technology stack, I utilized <a
      class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
      href="https://astro.build/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Astro</a
    > for the framework,
    <a
      class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
      href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      TailwindCSS</a
    > for styling, and
    <a
      class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
      href="https://netlify.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Netlify</a
    > for deployment. For implementing the blog, I used <a
      class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
      href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Markdown and Content Collections.</a
    >
    I decided to use daily builds, utilizing <a
      class="font-medium underline decoration-2 hover:decoration-neutral-800"
      href="https://github.com/features/actions"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      GitHub Actions</a
    > and Netlify's Build Hooks.

    <span class="font-medium">Implementing the blog</span>
    <span>
      I wanted all blog posts to follow the same schema and syntax, so I decided
      to use TypeScript and Zod to make this happen. Here is a picture of the
      config.ts file where the magic is happening:

    class="mx-2 border-2 border-[#ececec] rounded-md"

  />
  <span class="px-2"
    >Here is a utility function that filters all the drafts for production. The
    function reads the value of the isDraft property for a post. If the value is
    true, the post is visible only in the development environment.</span

    <span class="font-medium">Future</span>
    <span
      >I want to try out all the new features of Astro as they are released.
      That's why the project is regularly updated, and new features are added.</span

  <span class="px-2"
    >The code is available on <a
