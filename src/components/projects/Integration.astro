  <span class="px-2">
    I had the opportunity to dive into an exciting healthcare system integration
    project in collaboration with InterSystems and ATR Soft. The project took me
    through three distinct phases, each offering its own unique set of
    challenges and opportunities.
  </span>

    <span class="font-medium">My role</span>

    <span class="font-medium">Overview</span>
    <span>
      The project targeted towards systems integrations in the healthcare
      industry. The platform chosen was InterSystems <a

        IRIS for Health,</a
      > which is a widely used integration platform. Designing integrations visually
      and with the proprietary <a

    </span>

  <div class="px-2 flex flex-col">
    <span class="font-medium">Phases</span>
    <span>The project consisted of a course and two separate stages.</span>
  </div>
  <ul class="px-2">
    <li>- Course: IRIS for Health, arranged by InterSystems</li>
    <li>- Stage 1: Front-end development for an IRIS backend application</li>
    <li>
      - Stage 2: Learning development on the IRIS platform by creating an
      integration
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="px-2">
    During the first stage, I immersed myself in implementing the front-end for
    ATR Soft's underlying back-end. This stage provided an opportunity for
    creativity to flourish as I skillfully crafted a user interface using <a

    <span class="font-medium">Stage 2 and what I learnt</span>
    <span>
      The main scope involved working with the IRIS for Health management portal
      and constructing an integration application using components such as BPL,
      DTL, ObjectScript, and Router. I also did HL7 message transformations and
      statistical data gathering​.

  <span class="px-2"
    >Here I am doing basic routing rules for the HL7 messages:

  />
  <span class="px-2"
    >The statistical data was stored into the permanent storage in IRIS.
    Gathered patient data had to be anonymous. Here is a picture from the
    development phase, showcasing the utilization of test patient information in
    the SmartHL7 Message Viewer desktop application:

  <span class="px-2">In addition to the above, I also learnt:</span>
  <ul class="px-2">
    <li>
      - Working with Docker containers, HTTP business operations, REST API, and
      XML​
    </li>
    <li>
      - Creating interoperability productions, configuring, monitoring, and
      managing them, and creating custom business host classes
    </li>

    <span>
      Overall, this project not only expanded my technical expertise but also
      provided an opportunity to showcase my abilities in creative and
      innovative work. This is just one example of my journey.
